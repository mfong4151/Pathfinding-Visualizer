    "Depth-First Search (DFS): This is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before exploring another route",
    "In plain English, this means to traverse the matrix as if you're a child running through the aisles of a grocery store: run through the first aisle, turn the corner, run through the second, repeat.",
    "It is often implemented using a stack data structure, and is useful for solving problems such as finding connected components and detecting cycles in a graph.",
    "This is usually the go to algo on Leetcode. The majority of the graph questions you have will ask you to use DFS. In fact, you end up using it for some backtracking problems as well. Good to get this one under your belt."
