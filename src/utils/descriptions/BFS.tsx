    "Breadth-First Search (BFS): This is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., it visits all the vertices at the same level before moving on to the next level",
    "The easiest way to think about BFS is to think of searching in concentric circles: take the inner most one, search it, search its neighbors, search its neighbors' neighbors, etc. until you reach the outermost one.",
    `Unlike DFS, BFS uses a queue to keep track of positions instead of a stack. Moreover, BFS is usually introduced as the first cannonical "shortest path" algorithm. If you play the algorithm, you will see that it highlights the shortest path from start to finish.`
