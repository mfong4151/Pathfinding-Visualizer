          <h1>About this Project</h1>
          <p>
            This project started off as a side project to help me learn typescript, 
            but gradually became a general tool to help explain the way DSA works. 
            I've personally felt that visual aids are always a helpful way to solidify my understanding of what's going on.

           Much inspiration was taken from the   tutorial by Clement Milhaesque, but I've added my own touches and tools to maintain the wow factor as well as keep it a valuable tool for computer programming students:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>First, you'll notice that the start and stop icons are drag and droppable. I just thought this was a nice touch.</li>
            <li>Second, with each of these algorithms comes a brief explaination of how they work, what they do, in plain English.
              I'm aware that these aren't the most "erudite" explainations, but the whole idea was to keep it accessible.

            </li>
            <li>
                Third, I added the ability to play the algorithms step by step, to see how things play out in slow motion, I thought this was a nice touch, 
                and this is where the majority of the challenge came through. I'll admit, if you look at the source code there are decisions I could have made which could make the code base more followable, 
                but I guess whenever you decide to engage with OOP you live and die by your design decisions. 

            </li>


          </ul>

          <p>Here's an image of some of an example graphics that I produced:</p>
          <div className='udc'>
            <img id='bfs-bi' src={bfsBi} alt="A gif of bidirectional BFS" />

          </div>

          <p>
            The project was done in Typescript-React. This was an honestly odd choice, as I didn't benefit from the static typing too much. However, it helped me learn how things were done in the setting of large scaleable systems, so there are no regrets overall.
